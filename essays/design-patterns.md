## Design Patterns

Designing anything can be very difficult and also somewhat overwhelming at the beginning. At the start of a project, making a function, or even something like building a school, the problem of designing/structuring something is daunting. Tools that help with the format of your design are called design patterns. Design patterns are used to make things easier and guide you through the process of designing. The best part is these design patterns can be applied to a variety of design problems.

## Burger Design

Personally, as I have gotten older and dealt with many different projects in my education, I have noticed design patterns that I use and that have worked for me. Especially since I have gotten into coding, design patterns have been my best friend. My way of design pattern is using one of my favorite things in the whole world: burgers. The way that burgers are designed is a perfect representation of what goes on inside my head when trying to design a solution to a problem. 

## The Bottom Bun

The bottom bun is one of the most important parts of a burger. It serves as the base, carrying on top of it the whole weight of the rest of the burger. The bottom bun in my design plan is a very simple step that I go through when I think about design. My bottom bun is to really think about what the goal of my design is. What the overarching effect that I want my design to have. It may seem very simple, but this bottom bun serves as the backbone of the problem. You avoid aimlessly trying solutions by really formulating in your head what the final goal is. 

## The Meat

After making sure you really know what your design wants to do, next comes the meat. Here, you attack the problem head first. It is a core part of the burger, the main part that people love. In my burger design, the meat correlates to your solution to the problem. At the meat stage, you try your absolute best to solve the problem.

## The Vegetables/Condiments

The vegetables and condiments come after the meat. They serve as the compliment to the meat, giving the eater more tastes and textures to explore. In this stage of my design plan, we test the meat. We test the solution to the problem. We could even add on to the solution to the problem, resulting in a better result. A better burger. 

## The Top Bun

The top bun comes on after everything else. It is a sign that you have completed the burger. It is a sign that you have solved the problem. Once the top bun has been placed on top of the burger you can finally take a bite. We place down the top bun, ensuring that we have figured a solution to our problem. Now, we can enjoy using the solution to carry out whatever we need to do.
