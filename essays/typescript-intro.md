## Opinion on TypeScript

Before beginning to learn JavaScript and TypeScript

Fast forward to my first semester of college as a computer science major, I found it to be pretty difficult. While others had taken a programming course in high school or programmed as a hobby on the side, I was walking in blind. Although it was hard, I found it to be pretty interesting. I started to think about the world around me and how anything technology related had to coded by someone. It is fascinating to think about to this day. 

## Interests in Software Engineering

After learning more about coding in general, being introduced to different programming languages, and observing the ways different professors teach it only cultivated my interest in computer science even more. In terms of software engineering, I am very interested in the topic because being able to make a software application that does whatever you want it to do sounds amazing! 

## In the Future

Now that I am in a software engineering class, I am very excited to learn the necessary skills I need to make my own software. I would like to learn how to become a great designer, programmer, and team player. I am also looking forward to creating my own personal projects which are independent from school. 

know that creating software applications is not an easy thing to do at all. Things that I create will not be completed overnight. But whatever the struggles and circumstances, I will continue to strive to be the best coder I can be.
