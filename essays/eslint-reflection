## Coding Standards

Recently in my software engineering class, we have been required to follow a coding standard when we code. A coding standard is where we all have to have the same type of structure and look to our code. Coding standards are useful in multiple different ways. One way that they can be helpful is to improve the readability of your code. Code is not all about it simply just working. In the real world, we have learned that making our code readable is important for others to understand what we have wrote. Whether it be a professor, classmate, colleague, etc. Improving readability of our code is essential to working with others and just improving as a programmer as a whole. In order to enforce this coding standard for our class, we have a tool that helps us called ESLint. 

## ESLint 

We are using ESLint because it supports Javascript and Typescript, the two languages that we have learned in this class so far. We are also using VSCode to code on because it also supports ESLint. When I first saw that we were going to be using VSCode for this class, I was relieved because I have prior experience with it. After coding for an entire semester using Vi, this is definitely a nice change. When I started to download ESLint, I started to get a bit anxious because the download seemed complex and I noticed that some of my classmates had trouble downloading it as well. Initially, I thought that I downloaded it wrong but after becoming more used to using it with VSCode, I became more confident.

## Initial Thoughts

After about a week of using ESLint, I actually enjoy using it. It automatically shows errors in our code and incorrect formatting. Errors in our code is a given, but forcing us to improve the format of our code is an extremely good practice. Through forcing us to do things such as follow a certain indenting structure, make sure there is a newline, etc., it makes our code more readable and understandable not only for others but also ourselves. Some of the errors are also hard to understand so we can also improve our ability to fix code. Although it may be pretty tedious to fix all of the errors at the time, it will help us to understand more about coding languages and ensure that we are practicing good practices as software engineers.
